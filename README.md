# ShopSphere
A production-grade backend system for an e-commerce platform, built with reliability, scalability and correctness as first-class principles.

## Why this project exists

This project is built to:
- Learn how production backend systems are designed
- Practice writing scalable and reliable Java services
- Understand concurrency, transactions, and failure handling
- Build something that I can confidently explain in interviews

## What this project will NOT do

- No frontend or UI
- No microservices
- No external payment gateways
- No search engine
- No message queues

## Learning Approach
This project is built incrementally.
System design, database concepts (SQL, joins, transactions),
and scalability patterns will be learned and applied when
required by concrete features, mirroring real-world backend
development practices.
